# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
    Nothing, I refered some guide
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
    "all the numbers strictly to the left of the index" according to this sentence. didn't include index to the leftSum
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(n)
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # sum nums array 
        total= sum(nums)
        leftSum=0
        for x in range(len(nums)):
            rightSum = total- nums[x] - leftSum
            if leftSum == rightSum:
                return x
            leftSum += nums[x]
        return -1
