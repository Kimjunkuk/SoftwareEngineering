    AI answer
    The time complexity of the code you provided is O(mn), where m is the number of rows in the input matrix and n is the number of columns in the input matrix. 
    This is because the first for loop iterates over all elements in the input matrix, and the second for loop iterates over all elements in the reshaped matrix. 
    The time complexity is linear in the size of the input matrix.

    It's worth noting that the time complexity could be improved to O(min(m, r) * min(n, c)) if we used an iterator to iterate over the elements of the input matrix and the reshaped matrix instead of using two separate for loops. 
    However, this optimization would not change the overall time complexity of the algorithm, since the time complexity would still be linear in the size of the input matrix.

class Solution:
    def matrixReshape(self, mat: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        m=len(mat)
        n=len(mat[0])
        temp=[]
        reshapeM=[[0 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        if m*n != r*c: return mat

        for x in range(m):
            for y in range(n):
                temp.append(mat[x][y])
        k=0
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                reshapeM[i][j]=temp[k]
                k+=1

        return reshapeM
